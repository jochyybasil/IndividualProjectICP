# IndividualProjectICP
This project contains a program for my Intermediate Computer Programming class.
The program helps users to identify the shortest way to travel from one airport to another.

In my work, I use the hashmap as the main data structure and the java collections Lists.

The algorithm used to find the shortest travel route is the breath-first search.

The main function can be found in Main.java.

A user writes to a file by specifying the source and destination airports.
An output is generated and written to another file.
