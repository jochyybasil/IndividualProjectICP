# IndividualProjectICP
This project contains a program for my Intermediate Computer Programming class.
The program helps users to identify the shortest way to travel from one airport to another.

In my work, I use the Graph data structure and the java collections Lists and HashMaps.

The algorithm used to find the shortest travel route is the uniform cost search.

The main function can be found in Main.java.

A user writes to a file by specifying the source and destination airports.
An output is generated and written to another file.
